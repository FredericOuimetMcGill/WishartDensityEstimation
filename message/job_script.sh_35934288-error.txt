In addition: Warning messages:
1: UNRELIABLE VALUE: One of the foreach() iterations (‘doFuture-1’) unexpectedly generated random numbers without declaring so. There is a risk that those random numbers are not statistically sound and the overall results might be invalid. To fix this, use '%dorng%' from the 'doRNG' package instead of '%dopar%'. This ensures that proper, parallel-safe random numbers are produced via the L'Ecuyer-CMRG method. To disable this check, set option 'doFuture.rng.onMisuse' to "ignore".
